# RIT ArtistConnect

## What is this project for?

This website is intended as a resource to connect interested parties in the RIT
community with artists in their desired field. As someone who transferred into CAD
from one of the STEM majors here, there are very few points of contact for
non-artists to connect with artists on campus to create graphics/assets for their
personal and academic projects. In addition, several artists in our club have
expressed interest in opening commissions or wanting to gain experience on
creative projects for portfolio building purposes. This website would seek to bridge
the gap between the two, as well as promoting Drawing Club on campus.

### Transactions

The role of the database would only be to connect artists to interested parties on
campus, by providing contact information. No transactions will be held or managed
on our end

### Userbase

The database will be available to members of the RIT community, primarily catering
to current students, staff, and alumni with active RIT accounts. Anyone with an RIT
email address will be able to create an account, but in order to have an artist listing
visible, they must submit a form that will be available on the website.
